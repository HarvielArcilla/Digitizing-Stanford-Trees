# Digitizing-Stanford-Trees
Long-tern in-progress casual photogrammetry and rendering project ðŸŒ²

This project is my effort to digitize Stanfordâ€™s trees into downloadable 3D models.
I feel it is of utmost importance that Stanford's diverse set of trees survives
digitally, as changing climate pose a grave danger to many of trees here.

I am leveraging realtime LiDAR photogrammetry, to produce the physical geometry of
the models in a fraction of the time and effort it would take by hand. There are 
some challenges to using this method that require finetuning, but my background
in 3D render will hopefully aid me in solving many of photogrammetry pitfalls.

If you are interested in contributing to this project please reach out. 3D data
collection is tremendously time consuming and I need all the help I can get.
